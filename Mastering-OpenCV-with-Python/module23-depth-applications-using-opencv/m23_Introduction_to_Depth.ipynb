        "\n",
        "**Depth Estimation** is the process of determining how far objects are from the camera in a given scene.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Think of it this way:**  In everyday life, our eyes naturally perceive depth, allowing us to distinguish between objects that are near and those that are farther away. However, when a camera captures an image, it flattens the scene into two dimensions, losing this depth information. Depth estimation aims to reconstruct this missing third dimension by analyzing visual cues from a single image, multiple images, or specialized sensors, helping computers interpret spatial relationships just as we do.\n",

        "\n",
        "There are several approaches to generate depth maps:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Hardware-Based Depth Sensors (Active Sensing)**: These sensors actively measure depth by emitting light (like infrared) and calculating the time it takes for the light to bounce back, providing direct depth measurements. Examples include Time-of-Flight(ToF) sensors and LiDAR.\n",
        "\n",
        "  > **Did you know?** Many modern iPhones, starting from the iPhone 12 Pro series, are equipped with LiDAR scanners. This technology enhances augmented reality (AR) experiences by enabling precise depth measurement, allowing developers to create immersive applications using Apple's ARKit framework.\n",
        "  Give a [read here](https://www.opencv.ai/blog/depth-estimation)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Stereo Vision (Passive Sensing)**: This method uses two cameras, like our eyes! By comparing the slight differences between the two camera images (called \"disparity\" - how much objects shift position), we can calculate depth. It's like our brain figuring out depth from our two eyes. The two sensors have to be kept at a fixed distance apart and must be precisely calibrated to ensure accurate depth estimation.\n",

        "- **Relative Object Size** →  When two objects of the same type are present, the one appearing smaller in the image is likely farther away. This assumption works because the model learns from datasets where object sizes are consistent in real-world scenes.\n",
        "- **Focus & Blur** → Objects at different depths often appear sharper or blurrier depending on their distance from the camera. The model leverages this information to estimate relative depth.\n",
